## Project Summary

This website is purely a **portfolio website** for myself, **Ryan Thomson**.

A side goal for this website was to create it **without** using any **Website Builders**. It is also designed to be purely static so that it can be **hosted for free** by a third party. The only costs for this website are the domain registration and Google Workspace (for gmail).

## Development Details

- **Created** completely by **myself within a couple of days**. Because of this, the website is still rough and lacks polish in certain areas.
- Domain registrar used is **Namecheap**.
- It's programmed using **Next.js** with **NPM**. 
- It's hosted, for free, using **Cloudflare Pages**. The Git repository has two branches; master and deploy. Anything pushed to the deploy branch will automatically be picked up by Cloudflare Pages and made live within a couple of minutes.
