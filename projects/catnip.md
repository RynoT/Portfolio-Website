## Project Summary

Catnip was a **2 day game jam** submission for the **Epic MegaJam 2019**.

In this game you **play as a cat** making their way **through space** to get **back home**. It is a **rhythm game** where you must click the mouse **with the beat** whilst avoiding **obstacles**.

## My Contribution

As the programmer I primarily worked on the **ring trail**. 

The rings worked based off of a **state machine** and a **spline**. Whilst not totally flexible functionally wise (due to time constraints), the **ring trail** made it easy to create a **path of evenly spaced rings**. The mesh for each ring could also be set independently. The state machine also allowed for **varying ring radius** but this was not used in the final demo.

Since this is a **rhythm game** it was essential that the rings could be spaced in a way that matched the audio **beat**. 

I also done the little bit of **UI** that the game has, and handled the end-game **seamless transition** from space to home.
