## Development Details

- The game is written in **Unity** and published on **Android** and **iOS**.
- The game is **LiveOps**. Features are consistently being developed at all times with tight deadlines. 
- The development team was exceptionally large in size and had people of **all disciplines**. This includes an **external QA team**.
- Task management was handled using **Jira**. At **Tag Games** we had a dedicated production manager for this project who would instruct us on what tasks we needed to complete.
- Development involved using many **proprietary tools** such as **Zynga's** internal telemetry system.
- The CSR2 project is massive in size with over 10k scripts (Not all of which are used though).

We mostly worked alongside **NaturalMotion** employees and **Zynga** would get involved when there were server issues.

## My Contribution

During my time working on **CSR2** I fixed many **bugs** and contributed to the development of **one major feature**.

This feature was the introduction of **additional currencies and shops**. Since this mobile game relies heavily on micro-transactions for income, it was essential that the implementation of any currency was done properly and robustly. An improper implementation would cost the company thousands in lost revenue.

The idea behind this feature was to introduce **event-based currencies** which forced the player to spend any currency earned - since it would be unusable once the event was complete. It would also incentivize dedicated players to purchase micro-transactions since regular currency would not work in these new shops.

My responsibilities included; 

- Adding **serialization support** for these new currencies.
- Handling **encryption** and **securely saving** currency values to prevent third-party manipulation.
- Handling **client-side REST** requests and ensuring that they function properly with the server. The server-side part of these requests were handled by **Zynga**.
- Implementing event-specific shop support.
- Extending the functionality of the micro-transaction shop to support other currencies, and shop items with those currencies.
- Implementing and testing **telemetry**.
- Responding to **QA** through **Jira** and handling any tickets that they issue to me.
