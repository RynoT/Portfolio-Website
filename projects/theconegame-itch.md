## Project Summary

This project was developed for the [StaySafe Jam](https://www.staysafejam.org/). The jam was supposed to happen over 48 hours but we decided to extend that time to **2 weeks** for a better polished product.

The game was published to **itch.io** under the **Darkroom Interactive** name. This better allows the development team to use the game as a portfolio piece.
